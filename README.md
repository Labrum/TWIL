# TWIL
This week I learnt. In an attempt to remember and make
concrete weekly learning. I plan to write atleast a
small post every week that explains a single concept
which I have learnt or rediscovered. The plan is for me
to practice explaining and summarising new ideas.

This repo will also include some reviews or summaries
of books and articles I have read on any topic. The
purpose of this repository is not to be interesting,
but rather to record.
