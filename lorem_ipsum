The 'Lorem Ipsum' text is almost unavoidable when
choosing fonts. It's been in use as a standard
dummy text since the 1500s. Since then it remained
essentially unchanged while making the transition
to electronic typesetting. The text has been traced
back to 45 BC. It comes for 'The Extremes of Good
and Evil' by Cicero. More about that later, why do
we use it?

Readers are easily distracted by any readable text
when looking at a layout. Lorem Ipsum has a
relatively regular distribution of letters, which
makes it a more accurate dummy text than random jumbles
of letters.

Onto Marcus Tullius Cicero, who was a Roman philosopher
and stateman. It seems quite fitting that one Rome's
greatests orators words become immortalised so long
after his death. The translation of those words follow:

"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are 
perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
pains."

Cicero provides another apt quote, for my first post:
-- The beginnings of all things are small. --
